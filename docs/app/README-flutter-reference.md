## When to Use This Reference

Per ADR-001, revisit Flutter/native development if:
- MVP feedback reveals critical native capability gaps
- iOS adoption data shows significant pre-16.4 user base
- Phase 2 requirements (live tracking, in-app chat) prove PWA-incompatible
- Team capacity increases to support parallel native development
